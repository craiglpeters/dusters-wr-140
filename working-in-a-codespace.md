## Placeholder to update

Explain here how to work with a Jupyter Notebook in a Codespace. You can choose from the following options:
1. Open the WR140_MIRI_Image.ipynb document by clicking on it in the file Explorer in VS Code. That will prompt the Jupyter VS Code extension to activate, and then you can select the Jupyter Kernel that already has the packages installed because they were setup in the `onCreateCommand` in the `devcontainer.json` file
2. Run a Jupyter server manually by typing `jupyter lab` in the terminal, then CMD+Click one of the published URLs
3. Open in... from the https://github.com/codespaces page and choose Jupyter
4. Use the `gh` cli
