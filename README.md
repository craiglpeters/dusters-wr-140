## Image generation for WR-140

Credit for the data and notebook: WR-DustERS, [ERS 1349](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/approved-programs/dd-ers/program-1349), PI - R. Lau 

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that converts input from the JWST MIRI instrument and uses astropy.visualization to render an image of the WR-140 binary showing generated dust rings. This repository is for example purposes only, and may not have everything you'd need to work with the data in the real world. For more details about the research see:

## Working with the Jupyter Notebook

GitHub Codespaces is a tailored development environment in the cloud.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/craiglpeters/dusters-wr-140?quickstart=1) and you won't have to install anything on your computer to run the notebook!

You can then explore more about [GitHub Codespaces in the documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces), and find others in the [Codespaces Community Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/codespaces?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+sync+category%3ACodespaces). This repository is configured with a dev container to install all the tools and settings you need in the cloud so you don't have to worry about them. For more information about how this repository is configured to run Jupyter automatically, and how you can do this for your own projects, see the [Codespaces: Introduction to dev containers](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers) documentation.
